# iLogic DXF Generator for Autodesk Inventor

This project contains an **iLogic rule** for Autodesk Inventor that automatically generates **DXF files** from sheet metal parts in assemblies. The script recursively traverses the entire assembly, including subassemblies, skips **Content Center** parts and suppressed components, and then exports the sheet metal flat patterns into separate DXF files.

## Features

‚úÖ Recursively traverses the entire assembly and subassemblies.  
‚úÖ Skips suppressed components.  
‚úÖ Skips Content Center parts.  
‚úÖ Supports sheet metal parts and generates their flat patterns in DXF format.  
‚úÖ Automatically creates a flat pattern if one does not exist.  
‚úÖ Saves DXF files either:
   - in the same folder as the **main assembly**, or  
   - in a folder **manually selected** via Windows folder browser.  

üöß Future expansion: possibility to generate **STEP files** for standard parts.

## Requirements

- Autodesk Inventor (version with iLogic support)  
- `.iam` assembly files containing sheet metal `.ipt` parts  

---

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the main assembly in Autodesk Inventor.  
2. In the iLogic editor, create a new rule.  
3. Copy the entire code from the file `DXF_Generator.iLogic.vb`.  
4. Run the rule.  
5. At runtime, choose how you want to export DXFs:
   - **YES** ‚Üí save DXFs in the main assembly‚Äôs folder.  
   - **NO** ‚Üí select a folder in Windows.  
6. The generated `.dxf` files will appear in the chosen folder.

## DXF File Naming

The DXF file name is generated based on the part name (after the last `-`).  
This behavior reflects the **author‚Äôs personal preference** that part names should include a `-` to separate project/part information.  

- If the name contains `-`, only the portion after the last `-` is used.  
- If the name does **not** contain `-`, the **entire name** is used.  

**Examples:**  
- Part `Project-123.ipt` ‚Üí `123.dxf`  
- Part `Panel.ipt` ‚Üí `Panel.dxf`

## DXF Export Options

The DXF export string used is:  "FLAT PATTERN DXF?AcadVersion=2000&InvisibleLayers=IV_Tangent;IV_ARC_CENTERS;IV_FEATURE_PROFILES;IV_FEATURE_PROFILES_DOWN;IV_BEND_DOWN;IV_BEND"


If you want to customize these options (e.g., layer names), you can verify and adjust them in Inventor:

1. Open a sheet metal part.  
2. Generate its flat pattern.  
3. Go to **Save Copy As ‚Üí DXF**.  
4. In the configuration window, open the **Layers** tab.  
5. Review the available layer names and adjust the iLogic rule accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

‚ö†Ô∏è This rule was originally written for the **Polish Inventor interface**.  
If you encounter issues, you may need to adjust some command names or layer names to match your language version of Inventor.  

---

## Future Development

Planned or possible features to add:  
- Export **STEP** for standard parts  
- Export **PDF** drawings of parts  
- Configurable save options (paths, naming conventions, layers)
