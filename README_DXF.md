# iLogic DXF Generator for Autodesk Inventor

This project contains an **iLogic rule** for Autodesk Inventor that automatically generates **DXF files** from sheet metal parts in assemblies. The script recursively traverses the entire assembly, including subassemblies, skips **Content Center** parts and suppressed components, and then exports the sheet metal flat patterns into separate DXF files.

---

## Features

âœ… Recursively traverses the entire assembly and subassemblies.  
âœ… Skips suppressed components.  
âœ… Skips Content Center parts.  
âœ… Supports sheet metal parts and generates their flat patterns in DXF format.  
âœ… Automatically creates a flat pattern if one does not exist.  
âœ… Saves DXF files in the same folder as the source parts.  

ðŸš§ Future expansion: possibility to generate **STEP files** for standard parts.

## Requirements

- Autodesk Inventor (version with iLogic support)  
- `.iam` assembly files containing sheet metal `.ipt` parts  

---

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the main assembly in Autodesk Inventor.  
2. In the iLogic editor, create a new rule.  
3. Copy the entire code from the file `DXF_Generator.iLogic.vb`.  
4. Run the rule.  
5. The generated `.dxf` files will appear in the folders where the parts are saved.  

---

## DXF File Naming

The DXF file name is generated based on the part name (after the last `-`).

**Example:**  
- Part `Project-123.ipt` â†’ `123.dxf`  
- Part `Panel.ipt` â†’ `Panel.dxf`  

---

## Future Development

Planned or possible features to add:  
- Export **STEP** for standard parts  
- Export **PDF** drawings of parts  
- Configurable save options (paths, naming conventions, layers)
