# iLogic – Automatic PDF Export from IDW Files

This iLogic rule scans an assembly (`.iam`) and its components recursively, finds associated drawing files (`.idw`) 
and exports those drawings (all sheets) to PDF files. PDFs are saved next to the original IDW files.

---

## What this rule does
- Recursively traverses an assembly and all subassemblies.  
- For each part or assembly with a corresponding `.idw` drawing, opens the drawing and exports **all sheets** to a `.pdf`.  
- Avoids processing the same file twice.  
- Shows simple message boxes on completion and on some errors.

---

## Features
- ✅ Recursive traversal of assemblies and subassemblies.  
- ✅ Supports both parts (`.ipt`) and assemblies (`.iam`).  
- ✅ Exports all sheets from IDW drawings to PDF.  
- ✅ Skips already processed files to avoid duplicates.  
- ✅ Basic error handling and user notifications.

## Requirements
- Autodesk Inventor with iLogic support (Created in Inventor 2024).  
- PDF Translator (Inventor PDF add-in) installed on your machine.  
- Drawing files (`.idw`) must exist next to the part/assembly files and have the same base name.  
- Read/write permissions to the folders containing IDW/PDF files.

## How to run (step-by-step for beginners)

1. **Open Inventor and your assembly**  
   - Launch Autodesk Inventor.  
   - Open the main assembly (`.iam`) you want to process.  

2. **Ensure iLogic is available**  
   - Go to **Manage → iLogic Browser**.  
   - If you don’t see iLogic, enable it via **Tools → Add-Ins → iLogic**.  

3. **Create and run the rule**  
   - In the iLogic Browser, right-click **Rules → Add Rule**, name it e.g., `Export_IDW_to_PDF`.  
   - Paste the VB code into the editor.  
   - Click **Save**, then **Run** (or double-click the rule in the iLogic Browser to run it).  

4. **What happens**  
   - The script will process the assembly and subassemblies.  
   - Any `.idw` drawing found will be exported to a `.pdf` in the same folder.  
   - At the end, a message box will indicate the process is complete.  

5. **Troubleshooting**  
   - PDFs not created → check that `.idw` files exist and are correctly named.  
   - PDF translator missing → ensure Inventor PDF add-in is installed and enabled.  
   - Permission errors → make sure Inventor can write to the folder.  
   - Large assemblies → test on a small assembly first.

## Customization tips
- Change PDF export options (vector resolution, color mode) in `ExportAllSheetsToPDF()`.  
- Export only specific sheets by adjusting `oOptions.Value("Sheet_Range")`.  
- Save all PDFs to a central folder by modifying `oData.FileName`.  
- Add logging to a text file instead of message boxes for non-interactive automation.
