iLogic ‚Äì Automatic PDF Generation from IDW Files in an Assembly

This iLogic script is designed to automatically generate PDF files from IDW drawings linked to parts (.ipt) and assemblies (.iam) in Autodesk Inventor projects.
It supports recursive traversal of the entire assembly, ensuring that all components with IDW drawings are exported to PDF.

Features

‚úÖ Recursively searches the entire assembly and subassemblies.

‚úÖ Supports both parts (.ipt) and assemblies (.iam).

‚úÖ Generates PDFs for all sheets in IDW files.

‚úÖ Automatically skips already processed files to avoid duplicates.

‚úÖ Error messages for skipped components.

‚úÖ New: Choice of export location:

Yes ‚Üí PDFs are saved in the same folder as the main assembly.

No ‚Üí A folder selection dialog opens, letting you choose a custom destination.

How It Works

The script starts from the active assembly document (.iam).

At launch, you are asked where to save PDFs:

Yes ‚Üí PDFs go to the main assembly folder.

No ‚Üí Choose a custom folder via a dialog.

For each component, the script checks if there is an associated drawing file (.idw).

If found:

Opens the .idw file,

Exports it to .pdf,

Saves the PDF in the chosen export folder.

After traversing the entire assembly tree, it displays a completion message.

Requirements

Autodesk Inventor (Created in Inventor 2024)

Correct associations between parts/assemblies and IDW drawings

Code Structure

Main() ‚Äì starts the process, asks for export location, and triggers recursion.

ProcessDocumentRecursive() ‚Äì main logic for traversing assemblies and subassemblies.

ExportAllSheetsToPDF() ‚Äì exports all sheets from the .idw file to .pdf.

Usage Instructions

Open the main assembly in Autodesk Inventor.

In the iLogic editor, create a new rule.

Copy the entire code from the file PDF_Generator.iLogic.vb.

Run the rule.

Choose where to save your PDFs (same folder as assembly or custom folder).

PDF files corresponding to IDW drawings will appear in the selected folder.

Notes

The script does not generate PDFs for components without IDW drawings.

If an IDW file is missing links or is corrupted, it will be skipped.

You can extend the functionality, e.g., export to DWG or add naming rules.
